## Overview

Simple boilerplate for Craft CMS project. It's very barebones and makes a few assumptions that fits how I've been building Craft sites (ie working from a prototype and copying over Sass files and building up templates)

## Setup

This assumes that you are:

1. Cloning repo into a folder.
2. Downloading Craft source from site.
3. Copying source into folder.

From there you just need to:

1. Update package.json file with project name.
2. Run npm install
3. Copy the files in the config directory to `craft/config`
4. Install craft and build out the site.
